LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/btn_debounce_0/U0/btn_out__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[0]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[10]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[11]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[12]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[13]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[14]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[15]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[16]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[17]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[18]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[19]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[1]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[2]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[3]/CLR, design_1_i/seven_seg_display_0/U0/refresh_counter_reg[4]/CLR (the first 15 of 65 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
